== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= 1. Is it possible to make changes (add/delete images, change template or effect) directly in Wordpress? =

No, it's impossible. You should make all changes in WOWSlider application and generate a new module.

= 2. How can I remove your logo from the slideshow? =

Notice, it's possible with purchased version only. In full registered version you should go to Gallery-&gt;Properties-&gt;Images, uncheck "Watermark" option and re-publish your slideshow. Please use orignal images without "WOWSlider.com" watermark.

= 3. Can I use the free version of WOW Slider on my website? =

WOW Slider is free for non-commercial websites. But if your site generates any type of income, e.g. sells products, ads, services or just represents a commercial company, you should get a commercial license. Notice also, it's impossible to remove watermark from sliders generated with Free version.

= 4. I've recently ordered WOWSlider. Now I want to add it in Wordpress header. How i can do this? =

To insert WOWSlider into header you should use WOWSlider PHP code.

Go to
WOW Slider -> All Sliders

and click on "Excerpt view" button at the top right corner. Additional line "for templates" with php code will appear under line with shortcode.
You should add this php code into your header (Appearance->Editor->Header), for example:

&lt;?php wowslider(1); ?&gt;

= 5. How to add WOWSlider in Wordpress widget? =

You should install a special plugin that allows to add php code into text widget firstly. For example, "PHP Text Widget":
[http://wordpress.org/plugins/php-text-widget/](http://wordpress.org/plugins/php-text-widget/ "PHP Text Widget")

After that go to
WOW Slider -> All Sliders

and click on "Excerpt view" button at the top right corner. Additional line "for templates" with php code will appear under line with shortcode.

You should select a simple text widget and add PHP code into it, for example:

&lt;?php wowslider(1); ?&gt; 

= 6. How can I change the DOCTYPE declaration for universal compatibility in Wordpres? =

You should select
Appearance -> Editor
and change "header.php" from templates in the right column. 

= 7. What is difference between Free and Business versions of WOWSlider? =

Free version can be used on personal, non-commercial sites only. Business version of WOWSlider has an option to remove watermark from images as well as set your own watermarks.
All other features and options of Free and Business versions are the same. 
  
= 8. Drop down menus open behind WOWSlider =

It seems "z-index" problem. WOWSlider's value of "z-index" parameter is 90. So, "z-index" value of your menu should be greater than 90.
If problem will persist, please contact with customer support at support [at] wowslider [dot] com. Provide us a direct link to your webpage with a problem.

= 9. WOWSlider doesn't degradate nicely to CSS-only slider =

Notice, WOWSlider provides this feature since v.2.1. So, if you use an older version, it will not work.
Also, degradation to CSS-slider will not work, if you use "On-demand image loading" option. This option means that the images will be loaded from the script.
 
= 10. I bought WOW Slider Unlimited Websites license. Could I use it as a part of my own template which will be sold? =

You need Enterprise license in this case. With Enterprise license you can redistribute WOW Slider as a part of your applications or templates. Also the Enterprise license allows you to install the WOW Slider app on up to 10 computers. 

= 11. What is difference between Single Website and Unlimited Websites licenses? =

With Single site license you are able to install slideshows, generated with WOW Slider on any pages within your domain name.
Unlimited Websites License allows you to install sliders on an unlimited number of your own or your clients sites.
 
= 12. My slider always shows "Basic" transition effect though I selected another effect. Why does it happen and how can I fix it? = 

It seems that your slider works in pure css mode. Make sure that javascript is enabled in your browser. If problem will persist, probably it caused by jquery conflict. So, please contact with Customer Support at support [at] wowslider [dot] com and provide us a direct link to your webpage with a problem.

= 13. WOWSlider won't work in HTTPS site. Is it possible to fix it? =

WOWSlider generates paths to files according to your WordPress settings. So, if your site is "https", all paths in HTML code should be "https" too. Please try to follow this instruction:
[http://make.wordpress.org/support/user-manual/web-publishing/https-for-wordpress/](http://make.wordpress.org/support/user-manual/web-publishing/https-for-wordpress/ "HTTPS for Wordpress")

= 14. I have just downloaded WOW Slider for Windows. It was installed fine, however it will not launch at all. =

Try to do the following:

Control panel -&gt; System -&gt; Advanced system settings -&gt; (Performance) Settings -&gt; Data Execution Prevention.

Turn off DEP or add WOW Slider in the exception list.

= 15. I haven't received a registration code after the purchase =

The registration info is sent to your email instantly after the purchase is complete. In most cases this missing email can be found in your spam folder. If you still couldn't find your license info, please contact us at support [at] wowslider [dot] com with your order number. 

= 16. I have WOWSlider Single Website License. Is it possible to upgrade it to Unlimited Websites? =

Yes, you can upgrade your license for a price difference. Please contact us at support [at] wowslider [dot] com or further instructions.

= 17. I want to add WOWSlider on the frontpage only and not on the other pages. Is it possible? =

Yes, it's possible. To insert WOWSlider into frontpage only, you should add the following code in the "header.php" file:

&lt;?php if (is_home() || is_front_page()) wowslider(ID); ?&gt; 

(where ID is your slider identifier - number) in the place where you want to have a slider.
