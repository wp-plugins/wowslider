== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= 1. I've recently ordered WOWSlider. Now I want to add it in Wordpress header. How i can do this? =

To insert WOWSlider into header you should use WOWSlider PHP code.

Go to
WOW Slider -> All Sliders

and click on "Excerpt view" button at the top right corner. Additional line "for templates" with php code will appear under line with shortcode.
You should add this php code into your header (Appearance->Editor->Header), for example:

&lt;?php wowslider(1); ?&gt;


= 2. How can I change the DOCTYPE declaration for universal compatibility in Wordpres? =

You should select
Appearance -> Editor
and change "header.php" from templates in the right column.


= 3. Drop down menus open behind WOWSlider =

It seems "z-index" problem. "z-index" value of your menu should be greater than "z-index" value of WOWSlider.
If problem will persist, please contact with customer support at support [at] wowslider [dot] com. Provide us a direct link to your webpage with a problem.

= 4. Is it possible to make changes (add/delete images, change template or effect) directly in Wordpress? =

No, it's impossible. You should make all changes in WOWSlider application and generate a new module.

= 5. How to add WOWSlider in Wordpress widget? =

You should install a special plugin that allows to add php code into text widget firstly. For example, "daikos-text-widget":
[http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/daikos-text-widget/](http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/daikos-text-widget/ "daikos-text-widget")
After that go to
WOW Slider -> All Sliders

and click on "Excerpt view" button at the top right corner. Additional line "for templates" with php code will appear under line with shortcode.

You should add this php code into "daikos-text-widget", for example:

&lt;?php wowslider(1); ?&gt;

= 6. WOWSlider doesn't degradate nicely to CSS-only slider =

Notice, WOWSlider provides this feature since v.2.1. So, if you use an older version, it will not work.
Also, degradation to CSS-slider will not work, if you use "On-demand image loading" option. This option means that the images are loaded from script.

If problem will persist, please send generated module and project file (.wowsl) to Customer Support (at support [at] wowslider [dot] com), so we can check them. 
Write us also what browser.

= 7. I see only shortcode [wowslider id="1"] instead of WOWSlider on my page =

Notice, you need to add a shortcode on HTML tab in Wordpress, not on Visual tab. Please see a video tutorial on our website:
[http://www.wowslider.com/wordpress-jquery-slider.html](http://www.wowslider.com/wordpress-jquery-slider.html "WOWSlider video tutorial")

= 8. I haven't received a registration code after the purchase =

The registration info is sent to your email instantly after the purchase is complete. In most cases this missing email can be found in your spam folder. If you still couldn't find your license info, please contact us at support [at] wowslider [dot] com with your order number.

= 9. Can I use the free version of WOW Slider on my website? =

WOW Slider is free for non-commercial websites. But if your site generates any type of income, e.g. sells products, ads, services or just represents a commercial company, you should get a commercial license. 

= 10. I have PC and MacBook. Do I need to get the licenses for both? =

No, one license key of WOW Slider can be activated on maximum 2 computers. So, you can use the same license key on your Mac laptop and Windows desktop. 

= 11. I get "Invalid key" error message when try to register. =

Probably your antivirus/firewall/proxy doesn't allow Internet connection for WOW Slider or you have exceeded the maximum number of key activations. Please contact us at support [at] wowslider [dot] com for further instructions.

= 12. I purchased a WOW Slider license. How can I remove your logo from the slideshow? =

You should go to Gallery->Properties->Images and uncheck "Watermark" option and re-generate your slideshow.

= 13. What is "auto-renewal" option at order page? Does this mean purchasing WOW Slider requires a yearly license renewal? =

The WOW Slider Licenses include 1 year of free support and updates. If you select the "auto-renewal" option, your free support and update period will automatically renew at a discounted rate after a year. Leave the "auto-renewal" unchecked if you don't need it or plan to renew manually. 

= 14. What will happen with sliders, which I have already added to my website when one year of free upgrades ends? Will they stop to work? =

No, sliders and WOW Slider app will remain completely functional, but you’ll miss out on future product updates, and customer support.

= 15. I have just downloaded WOW Slider for Windows. It was installed fine, however it will not launch at all. =

Try to do the following:

Control panel -&gt; System -&gt; Advanced system settings -&gt; (Performance) Settings -&gt; Data Execution Prevention.

Turn off DEP or add WOW Slider in the exception list.

= 16. I bought WOW Slider Unlimited Websites license. Could I use it as a part of my own template which will be sold? =

You need Enterprise license in this case. With Enterprise license you can redistribute WOW Slider as a part of your applications or templates. Also the Enterprise license allows you to install the WOW Slider app on up to 10 computers. 

= 17. We are non-profit organization. We want to have slides without your logo. How we can do it? =

It's possible to remove our watermark with purchased version only. Please contact us at support [at] wowslider [dot] com for non-profit discount. 

= 18. What is difference between Free and Business versions of WOWSlider? =

Free version can be used on personal, non-commercial sites only. Business version of WOWSlider has an option to remove watermark from images as well as set your own watermarks.
All other features and options of Free and Business versions are the same. 

= 19. What is difference between Single Website and Unlimited Websites licenses? =

With Single site license you are able to install slideshows, generated with WOW Slider on any pages within your domain name.
Unlimited Websites License allows you to install sliders on an unlimited number of your own or your clients sites.

= 20. I have WOWSlider Single Website License. Is it possible to upgrade it to Unlimited Websites? =

Yes, you can upgrade your license for a price difference. Please contact us at support [at] wowslider [dot] com or further instructions..
